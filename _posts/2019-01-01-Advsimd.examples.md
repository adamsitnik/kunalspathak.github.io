### Introduction

It has been few years now that [.NET added SIMD support](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-jit-finally-proposed-jit-and-simd-are-getting-married/). Last year, in .NET Core 3.0, a new feature "Hardware intrinsics" added various APIs under `System.Runtime.Intrinsics` and `System.Runtime.Intrinsics.X86` for Intel x86/x64 architecture. You can read more about it in [this excellent blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/hardware-intrinsics-in-net-core/) from Tanner.
