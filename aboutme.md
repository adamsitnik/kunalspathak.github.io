This is the blog of Kunal Pathak. I am a software engineer at Microsoft working in JIT team of [.NET runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime). I have special interest in programming language, compilers and developer tools. In the past, I worked on Microsoft's Javascript Runtime [Chakra team](https://github.com/microsoft/chakracore) and a collaborator of [Node.js on Chakracore](https://github.com/nodejs/node-chakracore). My expertise are in backend low-level stack, assembly debugging, performance and memory analysis of critical products and services. This blog includes my learnings on this exploratory day to day life and might be helpful to others. 

The opinions stated here are my own, not necessarily those of my employer.

## Work history

As a software engineer, I have spent almost half of my life in front of computer.
#### Microsoft Corporation (2009 - present)

 * <b>.NET Runtime</b>: As part of JIT team, my focus currently is optimizing .NET 5 for ARM64. This involves doing perforamnce analysis of generated assembly code for ARM64 and comparing and contrasting it against Intel x64. The [epic issue](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/35853) highlights some of the improvement areas that I found.

 * <b>Prose</b>: I am fortunate enough to get chance work in [Prose](https://microsoft.github.io/prose/) team led by program syntheis pioneer [Sumit Gulwani](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/sumitg/). It is a blended team of researchers and engineers working together to bring program synthesis technology in Microsoft products. Here I worked on various interesting projects like translating the programs learned by Prose framework to [Java](https://microsoft.github.io/prose/release-notes/#release-510--20180207), internal engine of [code accelerator SDK for Python](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/overview/azure/prose/intro?view=prose-py-latest). I helped with integration of Prose technology in "import data from webpages" scenario of [PowerBI Desktop](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-connect-to-web-by-example) and [Power Qyery](https://www.decisivedata.net/blog/extracting-data-web-using-power-query) as well as [split column by positions](https://www.sumproduct.com/blog/article/power-bi-tips/power-bi-new-transform-split-column-by-positions).
 
* <b>Chakra</b>: Chakra was the first industry standard compiler codebase that I worked on. I played two different roles in this team. Initially I started as a Software Engineer in Test role where I wrote various tools to verify JIT optimizations like array check hoisting, array bound check eliminations, cross context verifications, etc. Most interesting tool that I worked on was to [automatically produce minimum reproducible code](https://patents.justia.com/patent/9436449) that triggers Chakra bug on Edge browser. After moving to developer role in Chakra, I worked on ambition project of [enabling node.js to run with Chakra engine](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/4765) called node-chakra. I was responsible to verify, analyze and fix compatibility issues of node-chakra with popular node modules. Another area that was super fun to work on was doing [performance analysis](https://github.com/Microsoft/ChakraCore/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20author%3Akunalspathak%20label%3APerformance%20) of node-chakra on [techempower](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/) and [acmeair](https://github.com/acmeair/acmeair-nodejs) and compare it against node.js numbers. There were also several [memory leaks](https://github.com/Microsoft/ChakraCore/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr%20author%3Akunalspathak%20is%3Aclosed%20memory) fixes that helped improved overall memory consumption of chakra engine.

 
 * <b>Windows Live ID</b>: This was my first team at Microsoft.

#### Infosys Limited (2004 - 2007)

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.

## Education history

With strong inclination towards computers from early age, I pursued my education in Computer Science.

#### Rochester Institute of Technology, NY (Dec' 2007 - June' 2009)

Passionate software developer having Master’s degree in Computer Science, with 7+ years of work experience in Microsoft’s Windows Live ID, Chakra and Prose team and 3 years of work experience in Infosys Technologies, I have good expertise in backend stack, compilers, low level assembly debugging, performance and memory analysis of critical products and services.

#### Vishwakarma Institute of Technology, Pune, India (Sep' 2000 - June' 2004)

COBOL / MASM

BASIC
