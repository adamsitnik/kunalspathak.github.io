Last Saturday I took my daughter to a drive-thru birthday party. This is typical birthday party organized now a days in covid-19 world. Parents drive their kids to the birthday person's home so kids can give birthday wishes and spend some time playing outside while trying to maintain social distancing. Here few of my daughter's friends were driving bicycle without training wheels (TWs). I could see my daughter wanting to drive like them, but she hasn't driven one without TWs yet. Her eye contact was firm for long time on her friends riding bike. With just couple of glimses at her, I could understand that she wanted to learn biking more than ever. After all, she has turned 5 years old now and she is driving bike with TWs? Well, I should say today's kids are fast. I didn't have that thought remotely when I was kid. I am pretty sure I learned biking when I was 7 or 8 years old. Anyways, seeing other kids biking, I too started feeling a guilt that I didn't take her out enough to teach biking. Enough is enough! I promised myself to teach her bike in next few days, rain or shine!

### Preliminary

As mentioned above, I have taken my daughter out more than few dozen time, always with TWs. One of the reason was that her bike size was 16" which was little bigger for her age and height. Children of her age would ride 12" or 14" easily. Hence, even with TWs on, I always held her so that the bike doesn't topple. We didn't want to go on a trail because of the corona-virus, we chose one of the business offices parking lots since they were too empty and we would get long stretch of straight road to practice.

### Day 1
I take out the TWs.

`She: Dad, why are you taking out TWs? Won't I fall down without it? (She forgot that just one day before, learning bike was her biggest goal).`

`Me: Well, when you were toddler, you crawled using your hands and legs. But slowly you grew up and now can walk and run with just two legs. Are you falling down by doing that? If not, why do you want your bike to ride with four legs? Even your bike is grown-up. So lets teach her to ride with two legs.`

She gets excited by thinking that we will be teaching her bike to walk on two legs by sitting on it. We start slowly while I hold her back as well as handle. She gets a taste of what it is to rid a bike without TWs.

### Day 2

`Me: Today, we will learn how to hold the handle straight. The bike will try to sneek, but you need to tell it to keep going straight and that it can't move without your permission. If you want to turn, move the bike's handle and it will know that you are asking it to make a turn, but never let it go without asking you.`

I start by just holding her back and leaving the handle for her to hold.

`She: Dad, see the bike is going in another direction. I am trying to keep it straight, but it is not listening to me.`

`Me: Yes, that's because your hands are just touching the handle and not actually holding it tightly. When you climb the rocks, you don't just touch the rocks but hold them tight. You need to do it likewise here too.`

The analogy helps here and in few rounds she manage to control the handle. Since I am running on her left side, she can't completely control the handle if she leans on her right side. I am confident that it should work out with some practice. She falls couple of times when I try to leave her back as well and letting her balance on her own.

`Me: One last thing that I want to teach you is what to do when you are about to fall.`

`She: But won't you be running with me? Will I still fall?`

`Me: Of course, you can't learn a bike without falling. In fact, you are lucky that you just fell down once or twice. I had bad accidents while learning bike. And, sometimes I won't be around and in that case, you will have to either manage how not to fall or learn how to not get yourself hurt in case you fall. While we are learning how to ride, you will definitely fall and you should learn what to do in those situations. Since you can't reach ground while you are sitting, try to get up and touch the feets on groud. The bike will fall down, but you will not. You should continue to stand. Just remember to try to touch your feet down. Alright?`

She nods her head pretending to understand what I said while also trying to memorize it. We had few incidents where she did fall, but she remembered the little trick and she didn't get hurt at all. More importantly, the fear of falling down went away because she knew how to not get herself hurt.

`She: Look Dad, I let the bike fall but I am still standing. I didn't fall. Yay!`

### Day 3

`Me: Today, we will just practice what we learned yesterday. Keep handle straight and don't get yourself hurt. Remember, the bike likes to run. If it continue running, it will never fall. But the moment it slows down, it want to take rest and so it falls down. So if you don't want to fall down, make sure you bike little faster.`

Today, I leave her frequently while watching her balancing the bike for 5~10 seconds. Her handle was moving, but she was forcing it back straight to balance the bike. This is a great progress. There is a fear that she might lose the balance or since she doesn't know yet how to stop, I run behind her. I can't just casually jog, but I have to be literally next to her bike. That was quite a work out for me. In next few rounds, her bike speed increases and so is my heart beat.

`She: Dad, I am loving it. This is really fun.`

`Me: See, I told you. You just took 2 days to learn biking. You took longer than this to walk. Learning to bike is way easier than learning to walk, right?`

`She: Yes!`

### Day 4

Today, we practised turns. At the end of our session, she is riding independently and taking nice turns. I am still burning my calories while running next to her bike because she is scared of stopping on her own.

### Day 5

`Me: Today let us learn how to stop. It is easier than learning biking. Remember, biking is easier than walking? Stopping is easier than biking. Whenever you want to stop, just stop pedeling. Doing that will slow down your bike and when it is about to stop, just touch your feet on ground while holding the handle of bike so it doesn't fall down.`

(I didn't know that kid's bike breaking works this way - TODO).

We practise few rounds with slow speed. In every 5~10 seconds, I ask her to stop. Then we increase the speed, but she keep riding it. I ask her to stop 8-10 times but she doesn't stop. Either she can't stop pedeling or she is just enjoying riding.

`She: When the bike is slow, I can make it to stop, but when bike is fast, I can't move my legs. I just go with the pedel's flow.`

`Me: That's ok. You need to do it little hard. Remember if you do bad job, how mommy and me ask you to stop it immediately. You need to do the same thing to your bike. Just tell it, hey stop right now. I am not pedeling you anymore.`

That seemed to help. She tries few times but then she falls down. Unfortunately, she doesn't remember her "touching the feet on ground" trick. We do some more practice and same thing repeats. Two things going on here. She is not putting enough pressure to stop the bike which is understandable because the bike is heavy for her age. Another, she is now little scared of falling after stopping and hence don't want to stop. I ask her to stop and she keeps riding.

`Me: Alright, it is time to go home. But we will only go home when you stop on your own.`

`She: Dad, hold me. I am not able to stop.`

`Me: You can stop. Just remember to do what I taught.`

She keeps riding for 10~15 minutes without stopping. All that time, she ask me to hold her to stop and I run behind her but not holding her. In the end, I get super tired and help her to stop.

### Day 6

`Me: Today, lets try different way to learn how to stop. We will learn by putting back our TWs. It will make sure that you don't fall. But just try to push hard on pedel to stop the bike.`

She is happy seeing back the TWs. We practice multiple rounds and TWs tend to help her little bit but she is still afraid that the bike might topple.

`Me: Listen, I am there to hold you. I am running with you with my hands around you. If you fall, I will hold you. You just try to stop.`

That gives her confidence of stopping with TWs. I push her to make the bike go faster and ask her to stop and she stops. With more practice, she can know stop independently with TWs. We take out TWs and she can now manage to stop her bike.

### Finally

My daughter knows how to bike end-to-end independently. After few days, I realized that I should googled to see "how long does it take to learn to ride a bike" and the answer was 30~45 minutes. We definitely took longer than than. We spent 30 minutes everyday for 6 days and that was about 3 hours to learn. But I will never forget those 3 hours. At the end of those 6 days, I felt happier than how I was when I learned biking. Not only I spent quality time with her, but it needed lot of creativity, impromptu and humorous thinking to explain her things and giving several analogies and examples. I made sure that her morale is boosted and she is excited all those days to go to learn biking. And the outcome is my daughter and I can go to a trail on our own bikes.
