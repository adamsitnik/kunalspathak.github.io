Last Saturday I took my daughter to a drive through birthday party. This was a typical birthday party organized in covid-19 world where parents drive by the birthday person's house, wish them and spend some time playing with them outside while trying to maintain social distancing. Here few of my daughter's friends were driving bicycle without training wheels. I could see my daughter wanting to drive like them, but she hasn't driven one without training wheels yet. So far, whenever I took her for bike ride, it was always with training wheels. Her eye contact was firm for long time on her friends riding bike. With couple of glimses, I could feel what she is been thinking all that time. I can hear her heart saying "Dad, I want to learn bike, it looks so much fun!"

Here are steps

Lessons taught
### Preliminary

- Training wheels

### Day 1
- No training wheels
- Just keep handle straight. Analogies - horse, if you do bad job

### Day 2
- Holding on the side where she leans most
- I was on her left side and she leans on right side.
- What to do when about to fall

### Day 3
- more practise of all the skills I taught previous day including
- keep handle straight and trying to leave (but still running behind her. Oh boy that is quite a workout, you can't slow down because she will fall)

### Day 4

- Turns
- Stopping - how i taught her? Stop doing bad job. 

### Day 5
- Turns good, but still can't stop. Riding fast in fear that she will fall. We kept riding for 10 mins until which I was tired and held her cycle so she can stop.
