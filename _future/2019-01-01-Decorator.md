Have you ever noticed how ordinary things start to look pretty when you are happy and pretty things even prettier? A beautiful room looks pleasing, no matter what, even on your bad days. Its one of the thing about making your home beautiful in your own way. It help you feel better on any kind of day. 

I want to share my favorite rainy spot of my living room. We don't have a balcony but has a great view of our patio right outside the window. So I often decorate this little spot with various themes to work like a balcony. I like to sit here with a mug of hot tea listening to the delicate raindrop on the greens. I am obsessed with Buddha decor and painting. My stress disappers when I look at them because I find them very calming and peaceful. I explore every possible opportunity to place them in my home and backward. 

I like India decor in USA. You can take an Indian out of India, but you cannot take India out of an Indian.

During my early designing days, my mother always suggested me to have little yellow decor in every room. May be she was right. I love the combination of yellow and black. I have purchased cozy, elegant yellow pillows that prove to be the best decorative accessories I have in my living room. Yellow adds little brightness to the living room even if the room does not get enough sunlight. They go along well with other black decors like black or dark colored carpet, black sofa or a black coffee table. I added mixed metallic silver lighting for the warm feeling around the room.

All the above things made a positive difference in my interior design. I think you do not have to add everything in the living room; the less decorative items you have the more relaxed and open space you will have. Select the item that match your personality and decor.

I love the black vinyl decorative screen panels, it looks with my Buddha painting and giving the room primitive charm. The black and yellow colors TODO with creamy, tan walls and white window frames. 

TBD : It took couple of rounds of furniture changes to get me there but I love with the end result.
