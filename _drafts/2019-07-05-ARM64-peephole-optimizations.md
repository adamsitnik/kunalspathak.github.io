This is the 3rd of the blog posts series that talks about ARM64 performance investigation for .NET core. You can read the previous blogs at:
*  [Part 1 - ARM64 performance of .Net Core](..\2020-06-30-Dotnet-Arm64-Performance).
*  [Part 2 - Memory barriers in ARM64](..\2020-07-02-ARM64-Memory-Barriers).

In this post, I will describe an important optimization during compilation process and how much improvement it can do to the generated machine code.
